# Medicines Drugs Recommender System
his project is a Medicine Recommender System designed to assist users in identifying appropriate medicines based on symptoms. The model leverages mEDA analysis to provide accurate and user-friendly recommendations.

# Overview
The primary goal of this project is to recommend medicines for common symptoms using a dataset of diseases and their associated treatments. By analyzing input symptoms, the system can suggest suitable medications, making it useful for healthcare applications, pharmacies, and individuals.

# Features
Symptom Input: Accepts a set of symptoms from the user.
Medicine Recommendation: Provides a list of recommended medicines based on the symptoms provided.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes supervised learning techniques to map symptoms to medicines.
User-Friendly Output: Delivers understandable results suitable for non-experts.
Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing diseases, symptoms, and corresponding medicines. The dataset is pre-processed to ensure high accuracy and relevance in recommendations.
